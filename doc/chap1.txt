  [33X[0;0YThis  manual  describes  the  [5XIdRel[105X  package  for  [5XGAP[105X 4.7 for computing the
  identities  among  relators  of a group presentation using rewriting, logged
  rewriting, monoid polynomials, module polynomials and [22XY[122X-sequences.[133X
  
  [33X[0;0YThe  theoretical background for these computations is contained in Brown and
  Huebschumann  [BH82],  Brown and Razak Salleh [BRS99] and is surveyed in the
  first author's thesis [Hey99].[133X
  
  [33X[0;0Y[5XIdRel[105X  is  primarily  designed  for  the  computation  of  a  minimal set of
  generators  for  the  module  of identities among relators. It also contains
  functions  which compute logged rewrite systems for group presentations (and
  complete  them  where possible); functions for operations involving elements
  of monoid rings; and functions for operations with elements of right modules
  over  monoid  rings.  The  [22XY[122X-sequences  are  used  as  a  [13Xrewriting[113X  way  of
  representing  elements  of  a free crossed module (products of conjugates of
  group  relators  and  inverse  relators). The package is written entirely in
  [5XGAP[105X4, and requires no compilation.[133X
  
  [33X[0;0YThe  package  is  loaded  into [5XGAP[105X with the [10XLoadPackage[110X command, and on-line
  help is available in the usual way.[133X

  [1X1.1 [33X[0;0YAn illustrative example[133X[101X
  
  [33X[0;0YA  typical input for [5XIdRel[105X is an fp-group presentation. This requires a free
  group  [10XF[110X  on  a set of generators and a set of relators [10XR[110X (words in the free
  group). The module of identities among relators for this presentation has as
  its  elements  the Peiffer equivalence classes of all products of conjugates
  of relators which represent the identity in the free group.[133X
  
  [33X[0;0YIn   this   package   the  identities  among  relators  are  represented  by
  Y-sequences,  which  are  lists [22X[[r_1, u_1],...,[r_k,u_k]][122X where [22Xr_1,...,r_k[122X
  are  the  group relators or their inverses, and [22Xu_1,...,u_k[122X are words in the
  free   group   [10XF[110X.   A   Y-sequence   is   evaluated  in  [10XF[110X  as  the  product
  [22X(u_1^-1r_1u_1)...(u_k^-1r_ku_k)[122X   and   is  an  identity  Y-sequence  if  it
  evaluates  to  the  identity  in  [10XF[110X.  An  identity  Y-sequence represents an
  identity  among the relators of the group presentation. The main function of
  the  package is to produce a set of Y-sequences which generate the module of
  identites among relators, and further, that this set be minimal in the sense
  that every element in it is needed to generate the module.[133X
  
  [33X[0;0YBefore  starting  on  the  main  example,  we  consider  a  simpler  example
  illustrating  the  use  of  [5XIdRel[105X.  All  the functions used are described in
  detail in this manual. We compute a reduced set of identities among relators
  for  the presentation of the symmetric group [10Xs3 = F/[f^3,g^2,(fg)^2][110X. In the
  listings  below,  [10Xs3_Ri[110X  is  the  [10Xi[110X-th  relator  for  [10Xs3[110X,  and [10Xf1,f2[110X are the
  generators [22Xf,g[122X of [22XF[122X.[133X

  [33X[0;0YIf we write [22Xρ=f^3[122X, [22Xσ=g^2[122X, [22Xτ=(fg)^2[122X then the first identity becomes [22Xρ^-1 ρ^f[122X.
  Similarly,  the second and third identities are the root identities [22Xσ^-1 σ^g[122X
  and  [22Xτ^-1  τ^fg[122X.  The  fourth  identity,  which  is  not a root identity, is
  obtained  by  walking  around  the  Schreier  diagram of the presentation, a
  somewhat  truncated  triangular  prism.  Taking the appropriate conjugate of
  each face in turn, we get:[133X

  \sigma^{f^{-1}g^{-1}f^{-1}}\ \sigma^{f^{-1}}\ (\tau^{-1})^{f^{-1}}\, .[133X
  
  [124X
  
  [33X[0;0YThe  fifth identity is equivalent to the fourth, as we shall show in section
  [14X6.2[114X.[133X
  
  [33X[0;0YIn  order  to  form  the  [13Xmodule  of  identities[113X  for  [10Xs3[110X the identities are
  transformed  into  module polynomials. The first is [22Xy_1 = ρ(f-1)[122X. The second
  and third are [22Xy_2 = σ(g-1)[122X and [22Xy_3 = τ(fg-1)[122X, while the fourth is [22Xρ(1+g^-1f)
  +   σ(1+f^-1g^-1+f^-1g^-1f)   -   τ(1++f+f^2)[122X.  Note  that,  in  the  fourth
  polynomial,  the  conjugators  are  converted  to  their normal forms in [10Xs3[110X,
  namely  [22Xf^2=f^-1,  f^-1g^-1f=fg,  g^-1f=gf[122X and [22Xfg^-1f=g[122X. Generators for this
  module are returned by the operation [10XIdentityYSequences[110X.[133X
